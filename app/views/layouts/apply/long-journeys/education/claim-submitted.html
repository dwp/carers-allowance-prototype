                  You need to send us the documents listed below, straight away. We cannot consider awarding your Carer's Allowance without them.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Once we receive your documents, you will usually get a decision letter about your Carer's Allowance claim within 6 weeks, but this may take longer.

                  If we need further documents, we will contact you by phone or letter. You do not need to contact DWP.
