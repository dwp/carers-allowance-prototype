        Compliance status

        This service is partially compliant with the

        Non-accessible content
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Some mobile devices used in portrait mode may experience content or links being cut off on pages that use table components. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        We plan to resolve this when we develop a new online application service.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        There is an issue on some pages where there are conditionally revealed questions with radio buttons. When using a screen reader on these pages, the numbering of these conditionally revealed radios is incorrect.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        This fails WCAG 2.2 success criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships), 2.4.6 (headings and labels) and 4.1.2 (name, role and value).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        We will resolve this when we develop a new online application service by removing any conditionally revealed questions, and following a one question per page approach.
