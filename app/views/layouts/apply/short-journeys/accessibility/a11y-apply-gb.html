      Using this service
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
      
      This service is run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
      We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      How accessible this service is
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
   We know that some parts of this service are not fully accessible:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  
      <li>JAWS screen reader software may not read out all page headings in Internet Explorer 11 – this is a known issue with JAWS version 18 or above, we recommend using a different browser to avoid this problem</li>
      <li>JAWS voice packs – some JAWS voices incorrectly read the term ‘P45’ as ‘45p’, this is a JAWS issue only affecting some voice packs</li>
      <li>Dragon speech recognition software – links that reveal hidden text on a page will not respond to the ‘click link’ command, but will respond to ‘click button’ – this is a known issue with the GOV.UK Design System details component
      </li>

  <li>some mobile devices used in portrait mode may experience content not fitting on the screen. You can view the content by either scrolling horizonally or using the mobile device in landscape mode
</li>
