                <ul>

                    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
                    <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard or speech recognition
                        software</li>
                    <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA
                        and VoiceOver)</li>

                </ul>

                <p>We’ve also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

                <h2>Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
                <p>DWP is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies
                    (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
                <h2>Compliance status</h2>
                <p>
                    This service is partially compliant with the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a>
                    AA standard.
                </p>
                <h2>Non-accessible content</h2>
            
                <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

                <h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

                <p>Voice recognition software users may experience issues with numbers showing for non-interactive elements on the page.</p>
                <p>This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).</p>
                <p>We plan to resolve this when we develop a new version of the service, by redesigning how the reports information is provided to users.  </p>
