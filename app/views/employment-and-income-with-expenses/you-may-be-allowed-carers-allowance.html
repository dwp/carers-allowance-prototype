      <p>If you expect to earn over £849.37 in the next month, you cannot get Carer's Allowance.</p>

      <p>
        You may be allowed if you have:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>expenses</li>
          <li>care costs</li>
          <li>private pension contributions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>These could all reduce your earnings.</p>

      <p>You can continue with your application if your earnings vary and some months you get more than £849.37. You will have to tell us your earnings regularly.</p>
